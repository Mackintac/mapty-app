# mapty-app

This Mapty app was another of the projects that I worked on while working through Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete JavaScript Course on Udemy. 

Using a map API you are able to set markers on an interactable map to track your running or cycling workouts!
Simply click a position on the map, input your workout information, and then press enter to drop a marker.

The markers are saved on your local browser storage so they will persist on that browser until you decidee to clear your storage.

Technologies used while making this: JavaScript, CSS, HTML.

The purpose of creating this project was to explore, learn, and then display knowledge of Object Oriented Programming fundamentals and experience using external APIs for use in the creation of an app.
